                <h3>Gorilla</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivorous,[1] terrestrial great apes that inhabit the tropical 
                forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern 
                gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is 
                highly similar to that of humans, from 96 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are 
                the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees.</p>
                <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 m 
                (4 ft 1 in and 5 ft 11 in), weights between 100 and 270 kg (220 and 600 lb), and arm spans 
                up to 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in), depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the 
                leader being called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by 
                darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35â€“40 
                years in the wild.</p>
                <p>There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. 
                Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN; all subspecies are classified as 
                Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered. 
                There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease, which 
                threaten the survival of the species. However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas 
                where they live.</p>
